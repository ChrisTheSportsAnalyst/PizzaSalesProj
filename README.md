Embarking on a journey to uncover the dynamics of our pizza sales business, we recognize the paramount importance of data-driven insights. 
To navigate the intricate landscape of our performance, we have outlined key performance indicators (KPIs) and chart requirements that will serve as our compass. 
The KPIs, encompassing Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order, will be scrutinized to gain a nuanced understanding of our financial and operational benchmarks. 
Complementing this analysis, we are eager to visualize trends through an array of charts, ranging from the daily and monthly trends of total orders to the distribution of sales across pizza categories and sizes.
Furthermore, we seek to unravel the success stories and challenges by spotlighting the top 5 best and least selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders. 
This holistic approach to data exploration and visualization sets the stage for informed decision-making and strategic advancements in our pizza sales endeavors.
